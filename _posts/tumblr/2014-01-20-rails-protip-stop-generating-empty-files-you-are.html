<p>I regularly work on projects where there are default pending specs and helpers/assets that are empty. This is bad for two reasons: firstly RSpec and the Asset pipeline still check/load these files which slows things down, and secondly they make the project harder to navigate.</p>
<p>I recommend adding this too yourÂ application.rb today!</p>
<pre><code>config.generators do |g|
  g.test_framework :rspec, views: false, routes: false
  g.helper_specs false
  g.stylesheets = false
  g.javascripts = false
  g.helper = false
end</code></pre>
