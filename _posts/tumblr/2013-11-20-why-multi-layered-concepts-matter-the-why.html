<h3>Defining &#8220;Concept&#8221;</h3>
<p class="p1">"Concept" is a pretty vague word - more often than not used in places where it doesn&#8217;t really belong. it can be a vision, an ideology, or even used to describe something unfinished. In this article, I&#8217;ll be using it to describe the <em>driving ideas</em> behind a project or product. </p>
<p class="p1">"Concept" is difficult to define for a reason: it&#8217;s not one single entity, but rather a collection of ideas that come together to form a coherent picture. Take Meta Trails - you could say that the general concept behind it was to create a new type of learning experience. But obviously, that isn&#8217;t the whole story. We have established the first layer of the concept - the coating that will cover the entire project, if you will - now, the Multilayered concept comes into play. </p>
<h3>
  Adding Depth to Concepts
</h3>
<p class="p1">You start by adding some depth to this idea.</p>
<ul><li><em>Why is it needed? </em></li>
<li><em>Who is it for?  </em></li>
<li><em>What does it do? </em></li>
<li><em>How does it do it?  </em></li>
<li><em>When is it needed?</em></li>
</ul><p class="p1"> If you&#8217;ve thought about your idea for very long you may already have the answers to each of these questions - but you have to recognise them as separate layers of your concept. These questions determine what directions you head for in the development process. </p>

<h3>
  Why
</h3>
<p class="p1">Too often we can get bogged down in functionality without first understanding the ideas that are driving us to create that functionality. It is easy to have a basic idea - just realising there is a <em>niche</em> for a certain functionality. In our case, we realised that there was a niche for creating a self-learning application that would be more focused on showing the progress of the learner.</p>
<p class="p1">To some extent we have our <em>why</em>: no other service filled this exact niche.</p>
<h5>
  Let&#8217;s be honest though - the fact that something does not exist does always not mean it should. (see grilled cheese cookies). 
</h5>
<p class="center"><img alt="image" src="http://media.tumblr.com/15a65831a03503eefededa10560c32a1/tumblr_inline_mwkcqmubIt1ss8b95.jpg"/></p>
<p class="p2"><em>thinking mm? recipe <a href="http://www.cupcakeproject.com/2012/08/chocolate-chip-cookie-grilled-cheese.html">here</a></em></p>

<p class="p1">So even though you&#8217;ve found your niche, you still need to justify it. Is there a genuine need for the kind of service you&#8217;re providing? Are there many similar services that fulfil that need?  Try not to just follow the cultural zeitgeist of the day - it temporary, and it&#8217;s often already been done.</p>
<h5>
  How often have you heard someone say they're going to make the next (insert popular web service here)? Often it&#8217;s just because that service was successful, and they want a slice of that success.
</h5>

<p class="p1">If there is no more depth to a concept than that, it&#8217;s usually doomed to failure. I&#8217;m not here to step on anyone&#8217;s dreams - but really. It&#8217;s very likely. </p>
<h3>
  Will it last?
</h3>
<p class="p1">With MetaTrails, we realised that people are more likely to try to teach themselves tech-centric skills than get a formal education. Since these skills are always evolving, there will always be something new to learn, even for those who did do a formal education.  This creates a continuous need.</p>
<h3>
  Is it needed?
</h3>
<p class="p1">There are numerous services providing self-teaching resources, so we wanted to find another aspect of self-learning - learning progress. Why? Because getting an education is both about resources and feedback. Encouragement can help a self-learner keep going. If you give them an incentive, making a mildly game-like interface for their self-learning, it might help keep them going. </p>
<h5>
  You need to fully believe that what you&#8217;re doing will make a difference to the area that you have chosen. A good difference. Something that will genuinely be useful to your intended audience.
</h5>

<h3>
  Let&#8217;s Recap the process for Why:
</h3>
<ol>
  <li>
    Find a niche for a functionality 
  </li>
  <li>
    Understand if it is a temporary or lasting niche
  </li>
  <li>
    Justify why that niche should be filled
  </li>
</ol>
<p class="p2">Why is often the first step in the process, since you won&#8217;t need to work out any of the other questions if the general concept fails at this stage.</p>
<p class="p1">Now we can move on to the other questions, which don&#8217;t need to be asked in any particular order. But since I&#8217;ve already raised the topic, we&#8217;ll start next week with: <strong>Who</strong></p>
