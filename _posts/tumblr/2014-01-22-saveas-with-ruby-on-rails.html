<p>Last week while working on a project I had to implement a new feature which allowed users to save as when editing an existing project.</p>
<p>At first i decided i was going to create some entirely custom controller actions for that, but I soon had realised the complexity of the task. Alex then came up with the <em>Deep Cloneable gem</em> for me to use, and I have to say this has been a very handy one.</p>
<p>This gem extends the <em>dup</em> method allowing you to select precisely which attributes and relations you want to be cloned.</p>

{% highlight ruby %}
  @project.dup include: {milestones: :tasks }
{% endhighlight %}

<p>Here is how we built it:</p>
<p>1. Install the gem <a href="https://github.com/moiristo/deep_cloneable">Deep Cloneable</a></p>
<p>2. Create a controller action.</p>

{% highlight ruby %}
    #post method
  def save_as
    @cloned_project = @parent_project = Project.find(params[:id])

    @cloned_project.assign_attributes(params[:project])
    @cloned_project = @parent_project.dup include: { milestones: :tasks }

    if @cloned_project.name == @parent_project.name
      @cloned_project.name = "#{@parent_project.name} (copy)"
    end

    if @cloned_project.save!
      redirect_to projects_path
    else
      render :edit
    end
   end
{% endhighlight %}

<p>3. <span>Let&#8217;s Clone!</span></p>
